[Meme Memory Game](https://ryanroyce.github.io/clicky-game/) is a game created to test your memory. Try to choose each Meme only one time and watch as your score goes up. Try to get all 12 without selecting the same one twice! 

## Technologies
- React
- Bootstrap

## Future Development
Further development of this application could include a modal when a score of 12 is achieved that would also play a fun meme related song. Upon lose condition a different modal would play a different song accompanied by a sad meme.
